I am a passionate researcher and engineer with a focus on particle physics and machine learning. My journey in science began with a fascination for the fundamental building blocks of our universe, which led me to pursue a Ph.D. in High Energy Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

During my doctoral studies, I had the privilege of working on the CMS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. My research centered on searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model, specifically investigating supersymmetric particles. This experience not only honed my analytical skills but also introduced me to the power of machine learning in processing vast amounts of data.

Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of particle physics and artificial intelligence, developing novel algorithms to improve particle detection and classification. When I'm not delving into data or coding, you can find me discussing the latest scientific breakthroughs on [r/Physics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/) or sharing insights on [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/).

I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe or advance the field of AI. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or just chat about the wonders of physics and technology! 

I am also a big fan of the [Nima Kondori](https://nimakondori.github.io/) YouTube channel.

I am a Master of Applied Science graduate from the University of British Columbia in the field of Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey has been guided by two distinguished professors: [Prof. Renjie Liao](https://lrjconan.github.io/) and [Prof. Purang Abolmaesumi](https://ece.ubc.ca/purang-abolmaesumi/), whose has been invaluable in shaping my research interests and approach.

Prior to embarking on my Master's degree, I gained valuable industry experience as a machine learning platform engineer at [Scenebox](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scenebox/about/), a startup that has since been acquired by [Applied Intuition](https://www.appliedintuition.com/news/scenebox). This experience provided me with practical insights into the application of machine learning in real-world scenarios and the challenges of deploying AI solutions at scale.

### Research Focus:

- **Video Diffusion Models**: I am exploring innovative approaches to generate and manipulate video content using advanced machine learning techniques. This research has potential applications in areas such as content creation, video editing, and predictive modeling of dynamic scenes.

- **Application of Vision Language Models in Medicine**: I am investigating how large-scale vision-language models can be leveraged to improve medical imaging analysis, diagnosis, and treatment planning. This interdisciplinary work combines cutting-edge AI technology with critical healthcare applications.

<!-- Throughout my career, I have developed a diverse skill set that spans both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. My skills include but:

- Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Proficient in designing and implementing various neural network architectures, including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
- Software Development: Experienced in writing clean, efficient, and scalable code using languages such as Python, C++, and Java.
- Cloud Deployment: Skilled in deploying machine learning models on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Adept at extracting insights from complex datasets and presenting them in a clear, actionable manner. -->

My educational background includes a Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Electrical Engineering from the University of British Columbia, which provided me with a strong foundation in signal processing, control systems, and computer architecture â€“ all of which complement my current work in AI and machine learning.
